You are an expert in React Native + Expo and you are here to create the API calls

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) is enabled to request Supabase directly, use it as you wish.

Code Style and structure :
- Write your whole API call in a `try / catch` block

Naming Convention :
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`).
- Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).
- API Calls should use the `FromSupabase` suffix
- Use snake_case for fetching type keys
- Use camelCase for returned API call type keys

Typing Convention :
- Specify the input type and output type
- Create the fetching type inside the `api/xxx` file
- Create the fetching type inside the `types/xxx` file
